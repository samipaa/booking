## Alert Detail



### [ SQL Injection ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/40018/)



##### High (Medium)

### Description

SQL injection may be possible.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/register
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: `username`
  * Attack: `useruseruser AND 1=1 -- `
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `The page results were successfully manipulated using the boolean conditions [useruseruser AND 1=1 -- ] and [useruseruser AND 1=2 -- ]
The parameter value being modified was NOT stripped from the HTML output for the purposes of the comparison.
Data was returned for the original parameter.
The vulnerability was detected by successfully restricting the data originally returned, by manipulating the parameter.`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Do not trust client side input, even if there is client side validation in place.
In general, type check all data on the server side.
If the application uses JDBC, use PreparedStatement or CallableStatement, with parameters passed by '?'
If the application uses ASP, use ADO Command Objects with strong type checking and parameterized queries.
If database Stored Procedures can be used, use them.
Do *not* concatenate strings into queries in the stored procedure, or use 'exec', 'exec immediate', or equivalent functionality!
Do not create dynamic SQL queries using simple string concatenation.
Escape all data received from the client.
Apply an 'allow list' of allowed characters, or a 'deny list' of disallowed characters in user input.
Apply the principle of least privilege by using the least privileged database user possible.
In particular, avoid using the 'sa' or 'db-owner' database users. This does not eliminate SQL injection, but minimizes its impact.
Grant the minimum database access that is necessary for the application.

#### CWE Id: [ 89 ](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)


#### WASC Id: 19

#### Source ID: 1

### [ CSP: Wildcard Directive ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10055/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks. Including (but not limited to) Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/register
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `content-security-policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `The following directives either allow wildcard sources (or ancestors), are not defined, or are overly broadly defined:
script-src, style-src, img-src, connect-src, frame-src, frame-ancestors, font-src, media-src, object-src, manifest-src, worker-src, form-action

The directive(s): frame-ancestors, form-action are among the directives that do not fallback to default-src, missing/excluding them is the same as allowing anything.`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is properly configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Format String Error ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/30002/)



##### Medium (Medium)

### Description

A Format String error occurs when the submitted data of an input string is evaluated as a command by the application.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/register
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: `password`
  * Attack: `ZAP%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n%s
`
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `Potential Format String Error. The script closed the connection on a /%s.`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Rewrite the background program using proper deletion of bad character strings. This will require a recompile of the background executable.

#### WASC Id: 6

#### Source ID: 1

### [ Missing Anti-clickjacking Header ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10020/)



##### Medium (Medium)

### Description

The response does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/register
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-frame-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 1

### Solution

Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.
If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.

### [ User Agent Fuzzer ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10104/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

Check for differences in response based on fuzzed User Agent (eg. mobile sites, access as a Search Engine Crawler). Compares the response statuscode and the hashcode of the response body with the original response.
